# Compressed-Air-System-Control

This repository contains the code along with some supplementary information used for a university project called “Energy Efficiency of Control of a Compressed Air System”. The program works by using air demand data received from a leading car manufacturer's 12 bar compressed air system. The aim of this project was to simulate the control of the compressors in the car manufacturer's compressed air system  and apply different sequencing logic and different individual compressor operation modes to see how they would affect the energy efficiency of the system. The scripts contained in the directories have docstrings on the logic used in the programs. The 'simulations' directory contains the scripts and results that were used directly for the findings made and analysed in the university project (the code is simple). The 'interactive_simulations' folder contains programs simulating the car manufacturers compressed air system but with user interactabilty applied.

The CasSims directory has been added that present the scripts used that perform the compressed air system simulations with a graphical user interface to make it more user friendly. The main script in the directory is "CasSims" and the purpose of the program is to produce graphs on the performance metrics of the compressors based on user defined inputs on the compressors. Screenshots have of the GUIs have been added to the directory.
